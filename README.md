# xamarin-forms-book-samples

Sample code for the book *Creating Mobile Apps with Xamarin.Forms*. The book can be downloaded from http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/xamarin-forms/creating-mobile-apps-xamarin-forms/.

This **original-code-from-book** branch contains the code as it appeared in the *Creating Mobile Apps with Xamarin.Forms* book. The **master** branch contains updated code and projects to reflect changes in Xamarin.Forms since the book was pubished.

See the **README.MD** file in the **master** branch for more details.
